# Eleven: Your Daily Household Task Companion

Eleven is a Telegram-based app designed to make household chores feel manageable, consistent, and stress-free. By breaking down larger cleaning tasks into smaller, actionable subtasks, Eleven helps you tackle a little bit every day, ensuring that your home stays clean without overwhelming your schedule.

## Why Eleven?
Life is busy, and finding time for household chores can feel daunting. Eleven aims to solve this by:

1. **Breaking Down Tasks:** Instead of facing broad, intimidating tasks like "Clean the bathroom" or "Vacuum the house," Eleven gives you focused subtasks such as "Clean the toilet" or "Vacuum the living room."

2. **Daily Micro-Commitments:** Each day, Eleven provides a small list of household tasks that take no longer than **11 minutes** to complete in total. This keeps your daily cleaning effort light and achievable.

3. **Regularity Without Burnout:** By spreading tasks evenly throughout the week, Eleven helps maintain a clean home without dedicating large chunks of time to cleaning marathons.

4. **Focus on Independent Tasks:** The app only includes tasks that you can schedule consistently, avoiding ad-hoc responsibilities like shopping.

## Example Tasks
Here are some examples of the kinds of subtasks Eleven will assign:
- Vacuum the living room
- Clean the kitchen sink
- Wipe bathroom mirrors
- Take out recycling
- Dust the bookshelf

## How It Works
1. **Telegram Interaction:** All interactions happen via a Telegram bot. Simply start a conversation with the bot to receive your daily task list.
2. **Daily Task List:** The bot sends a curated list of tasks that fit within the 11-minute limit.
3. **Smart Task Distribution:** Tasks are distributed throughout the week to ensure all areas of your home receive attention regularly.
4. **Simple Progress Tracking:** Mark tasks as completed directly within the chat and see your progress over time.

## Future Features
- **Customization:** Add your own tasks or adjust the priority of existing ones.
- **Reminders:** Optional notifications to keep you on track.
